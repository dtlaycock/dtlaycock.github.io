			<p>Thirteen years is a really long time to work anywhere.  I used to joke that it was like a prison sentence.  Looking back on my experiences over the last 13 years there is a lot of good, and a lot to be thankful for.</p>

<p>I joined The Economist in 2005 working for the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) as a developer for an in house template / publishing system for the country analysis reports that the EIU produces.  Technology wise it was familiar ground for me, so after a couple years it was time for a change.</p>

<p>I moved to the Economist.com team, joining as an inexperienced web developer.  The site at the time was a custom built CMS, with ColdFusion generating the site.  The learning curve was steep, the CMS itself and how that worked were particularly arcane.  It took the better part of a year for me to feel like I really knew what I was doing, and not long after that there was another change waiting in the wings.</p>

<p>The next change was a radical one, it was a major transformation of the engineering team, introducing a completely new technology stack, type of software, and approach to engineering.  We simultaneously transitioned from custom to open-source, ColdFusion to PHP, and waterfall to scrum.  Surprisingly, despite the magnitude of the change, it worked beautifully.  For those involved at that time it is still seen as a golden age.  Empowered teams working collaboratively with a clear sense of purpose, that&rsquo;s still a goal for all the teams I work on.</p>

<p>Rebuilding the site in Drupal was a journey, one that took longer than expected. Working heavy hitters from the Drupal community was a great way to hit the ramp up the existing engineering teams.  Supported by a continuous migration of content and user data we were able to move the site piece by piece until eventually arriving at a place when what remains is less valuable than the cost of maintaining the old system.  That kind of strangler pattern is still a common approach today, especially when breaking down monolithic systems.  Alas that is just the kind of system we ended up building in Drupal.</p>

<p>We built everything in Drupal.  Yes, it is a very flexible framework, but I would argue any single technology solution becoming &ldquo;the solution&rdquo; to diverse problems is a bad thing.  5+ years of projects big and small occupying the same codebase is going to create some challenges.  Process introduced to protect business critical functionality in one part of the codebase stifled the ambitions of smaller more experimental features.  Meanwhile the Drupal community moved on, new versions, and their own longer than expected overhaul landed pushing our creaking monolith into end of life status.</p>

<p>Predictably the answer was breaking up the monolith.  That had been clear for a number of years, and various approaches had been discussed.  With my Drupal hat firmly on my head I imagined a cluster of Drupal sites, connected by APIs, supporting differing levels of process and tolerance for changes.  The front end team longed to be free of the constraints of building within a CMS and looked to create a modern, responsive, decoupled site.  While the Ops team were busy completing a migration of the existing site to AWS.  All those would come together to start another major transformation project in 2015.</p>

<p>The project would create a decoupled site, within AWS, with a continuous deployment model from the start.  Crucially it would also create an abstraction layer of microservices in front of the Drupal CMS standardizing the content structure and supporting future goals of consolidating access to content sitting in a growing number of silo content stores.  That abstraction layer became known as the Content Platform (CP).</p>

<p>Taking over the ownership of the CP from the project team, a medley of internal and external resources, was the second major transformation for the engineering team.  This time moving from open-source to software-as-a-service, PHP CMS development to microservices in Golang, and a silo mentality to DevOps.  Again the results were outstanding.</p>

<p>The CP team (the core in house engineers and the GlobalLogic engineers that allowed our team to scale up) have been the best that I have worked with.  The platform itself, the AWS services it leverages and enterprise integration patterns that govern its behaviour have been fascinating to work with.  It has been eye-opening to witness the potential for cloud providers to unlock complex technologies for teams of all sizes without burying them under a mound of complexity.</p>

<p>Managing a platform from its Minimal Viable Product (MVP) state to maturity has been equally rewarding.  Enabling the platform consumers, internal product and engineering teams, to deliver on their own goals by adapting the platform to their needs.  Crafting a roadmap that balances the value of those short term needs against long term reusable platform capabilities.  Seeing the platform evolve and strengthen as we added more content sources, distribution channels and consumers gives me confidence that it will continue to add value to the organization.</p>

<p>There is so much more I would have like to do with the CP, but it is the right time for a change.  The organization itself is transitioning.  I realized during my last couple of weeks, thinking of all the changes, that most of the people that I would thank were no longer at the company.  So through this post I thank them, for taking the chance on an inexperienced web developer, introducing agile and showing me the value of empowered teams, and for the frequent and transformative technology changes that kept me growing at the organization.</p>
