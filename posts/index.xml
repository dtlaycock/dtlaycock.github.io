      <description>Thirteen years is a really long time to work anywhere. I used to joke that it was like a prison sentence, except that is unfair even during the darker times.
Looking back on my experiences over the last 13 years there is a lot of good, and a lot to be thankful for. However I realized that most of the people that I would thank were no longer at the company.</description>

      <description>A thousand miles of corn I was looking forward to seeing more of the country. Since moving to the USA I&amp;rsquo;ve primarily visited places for conferences or winter sports. Moving to the Hudson Valley has made travel easier, but we have not explored much beyond New York and neighboring states. Driving across the country would be a great opportunity to see more.
Our home life in the Hudson Valley centers around real food.</description>
